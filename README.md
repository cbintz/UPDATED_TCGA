Machine Learning final project: unsupervised clustering of genes, feature selection, trained neural net to predict survival

Final project for Middlebury CS 451: Machine Learning.

Obtained lung cancer data from TCGA.
Used unsupervised agglomerative clustering to cluster genes to demonstrate that patients cluster on survival status.
Used mutual info classification and step forward feature selection to select a smaller subset of genes to train nueral net to predict survival.
